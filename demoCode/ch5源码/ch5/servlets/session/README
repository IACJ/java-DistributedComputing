This is a set of files obtained from Wrox press.  They
are some of the source files of the code shown in Chapter
18 of the text book.

The files are:
   README           this file
   Cookie.html      the web page which initiates the Cart servlet
   Cart.java        source code for teh shopping cart servlet

To try out the sample:
 1. Copy the files into a directory in your account.
 2. Modify the .html file to replace the URL for the servlet to
    the URL for your servlet: you will have to change the host name
    and the port number.
 3. File the .html file to the appropriate directory: on falcon, it
    should be under <i>www/...</i>; on the America machines, it should be
    under <i>~/public_html</i>.
 4. In the Cart.java file, make change to the URL redirected to at the
    end of the program so that the redirection is to your servlet, e.g.,
       res.sendRedirect("http://nebraska.calpoly.edu:8081/servlet/Cart");
 4. Compile the Cart.java file, and file the .class file in ~/servlets
    on the America system you speicifed in the URL.
 5. Start the servlet runner on the America system specified in the
    web page, at a port of your choice, like this:
      %servletrunner -d /home/mliu/servlets -p 12345
    (It is recommended that you make a run file to contain this command
     and to use as a run script.)
 6. Access your web page and observe the update on the 
    contents in the shopping cart.  See if you can follow the code and
    explain to yourself what you observe.
    
***** If you make changes to a servlet, you must refile it in the 
      designated directory.  You may have to stop the jswdk server and
      restart it for the modified servlet to be invoked. ****
