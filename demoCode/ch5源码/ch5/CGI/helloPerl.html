This page contains an action tag which specifies a web script.
Upon retrieving this page from the web server, the browser
processes the contents and, when the SUBMIT button is pressed,
requests the server to run the script or program specified
with the action tag.

The script or program is either a run-script written in a 
script language such as Perl, or an executable generated
 from a source program written in a language such as C/C++.
